Steps to solve a particular environment, 
1. Make an example.py folder in the `/examples` directory. Look at `/examples/hopper-2.py` for reference.
2. Define an "inital_code" variable in `/funsearch/__main` and change the varibale name on line 389 to the inital_code you have defined
3. run test.sbatch
   NOTE: change the `examples/hopper.py` to your example file in `test.sbatch` (see line 20) in `test.sbatch`.
